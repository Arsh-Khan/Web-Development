        A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that
        forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116).

        Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a
        paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly
        journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
